# Introduction
The aim of this guide is to be a comprehensive resource for developing projects following KUWAITNET standards. It’s mandatory the guide to be followed 100% in all aspects without deviation, except when a derogation has been given by a superior.

It’s important to follow the rules explained here word by word to make all our life easier. How difficult can be when you are assigned to a project and all the things you are familiar with are not there, instead everything is done the opposite way you like?
